# Tensorflow Operator

---

## Goal
In this notebook, we're going to getting start with tensorflow Operators. What are tensorflow operators and we will run some of them.


## Introduction to Operator
Tensorflow prodives certain predefined operators that can be performed on tensors. Tensorflow operator helps us to perform basic operation on tensor easily.
___
There are sevral types of operations that can be done on tensorflow. Some of them are mentioned below:
* Arithmetic operations : add, subtract, multiply,...
* Matrix operations : matmul, matrix_inverse, ...
* Control flow operations : tuple, group, ...
* Logical operations : logical_and, logical_not, ...
* Comparision operations: equal, less, not_equal, ...
* Debugging operations : is_finite, is_inf,..

Example of each type of operations by operators is shown in the code file.


### Conclusion
Tensorflow operation is very useful in especially when we are working with tensor and matrix. [Click Here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/op_select_allowlist) to visit list of all the operator in tensorflow.
